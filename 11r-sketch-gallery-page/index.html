  <p>At the moment of the COVID-19 epidemic, people may be infected when they are exposed to the virus. Recently, Academician Wang Fusheng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences released the research results, “COVID-19 is a self limited disease”. After people are infected with COVID-19, the virus will be controlled and eliminated by the immune system after a period of time. The spleen as the largest immune organ of the human body plays a very important role in protecting people’s bodies. The project, “defeat the virus”, shows part of the immune function of the spleen and how the immune mechanism protects our bodies.</p>
